# 1.1 (initial release)

This is the first official release of SKA.  SKA currently supports correct
processing of data-dependency hazards (memory access stalls cannot be
handled correctly by static analysis) and structural hazards.  SKA also
supports multiple issue of an arbitrary number of ports.

-	Fixed multi-line switch statement from IR code.
	If newline characters are detected during processing output, they
	are removed (only in the ska output).

-	Added support structure for intrinsics functions.
	This actuall includes anything that is issued as a 'call'.  Very
	limited support for x86 only right now.  Adding complete support for
	x86 is on the TODO list.  This is ultimately how OpenCL intrinsics
	will be handled.

-	Added collection of various statistics.
	Currently, no metrics are computed in the driver program.  Potentially,
	metric computation will be added as part of libska, so that both the
	driver and viewer programs can compute them on the fly.

-	Mangled call names are not currently recognized by LLVM.
	This may change when support for the OpenCL SPIR is added.  In the
	current SKA release, demangling is not supported.  It can be turned
	on by definging USE_MANGLED_CALL_NAMES.

-	Added skaview program with basic mouse control and highlighting.
	Viewer is handy for longer execution streams.

NOTE: the architecture files that are included in this release are still
under development.
