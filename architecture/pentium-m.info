#maps LLVM IR to pentium-m instruction set
#which is x86-32

ret --> RETN
br --> JMP (near)
sw --> JMP (near)
indirectbr --> JMP (near)
resume --> RETN
unreachable --> no mapping, what is this ?

add --> ADD  , for integers
        FADD , for floating point and double
        PADD , for vector integer
        ADDSS, for vector floating point 

...

almost identical to haswell.info
only the difference are shown

--- We are using pentium-M latencies for vector instructions
as they are not available for xeon-phi
